# color-guessing_game

## Introduction
It's a little color-guessing game: every time the program generates a few different colors and pick one of them as an answer. And the player can guess which one is correct, given the rgb value of the color answer.
The player can change the easy mode or hard mode:easy mode generates 3 colors while hard mode generates 6 colors each time.
The player can also choose to start a new game at any time.
