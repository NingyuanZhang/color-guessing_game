## Introduction
It's a little color-guessing game: every time the program generates a few different colors and pick one of them as an answer. And you can guess which one is correct according to the corresponding rgb value.
You can also change the easy mode or hard mode:easy mode generates 3 colors while hard mode generates 6 colors each time.
